# logical operators are either "true" or "false" or "yes" or "no" or "1" or "0"
# # equal to ==
# not equal to !=
# less than <
# greater than <
# less than and equal to <=
# greater than and equal to >=

# # is 4 equal to 4?
# print(4==4)
# print(4!=4)
# print(4>3)
# print(3<6)
# print(3<=5)
# print(5>=4)

# Application of logical operators
hammad_age=4
age_at_school=5
print(hammad_age==age_at_school)

#input operator and logicals
age_at_school=5
hammad_age=input("How old is hammad? \n") # input function
hammad_age=int(hammad_age) # Typecasting
print(type(hammad_age))
print(hammad_age==age_at_school) # Logical operator

# convert input
